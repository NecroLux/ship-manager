# Ship Manager — Roadmap

_Last updated: 2026-02-11_

## High Priority (Core Functionality)

- [ ] **Crew Tab reorganization** — Split compliance, add voyage/host counts, centre status
- [ ] **Data health** — Centralize all data sources so Overview doesn't pull directly from external sheets
- [ ] **Actions Tab upgrades** — Sailing → Squad Leaders, + staff comments parsing

## Medium Priority (Features & Quality)

- [ ] **PDF/DOCX Export** — Squad-split crew roster, include Overview snapshot
- [x] **Awards Tab** — Medal scrubber with eligibility + endorsement tracking (auto-detect voyage/host/conduct/service stripes). Sub-tabs by responsible person.
- [x] **Promotions Tab** — Promotion readiness tracker with auto-detect prereqs, manual checklists, person-based sub-tabs
- [ ] **Top Hosts/Voyagers accuracy** — Fix data source on Overview

## Polish & Analytics

- [ ] **Ship Composition icons** — Fix command member round icon display (Red/Pink/Purple)
- [ ] **Snapshot insights** — Month-to-month trend analysis and deltas
- [ ] **Overview insight cards** — Awards this month, Key wins, MOTD, engagement highlights
- [ ] **Spice paywall easter egg** — 4 Ancient Coins unlock (fun one!)
